# Examples

The examples in this folder are specific to the Milk-V Duo, but they do not cover every supported peripheral, nor all their features. For something more comprehensive, see the [examples folder](https://github.com/denko-rb/denko/tree/master/examples) from the main Denko gem, and adapt those as needed.

That folder will also include examples for hardware that the Milk-V Duo does not have, like DAC (Analog Output), or on-board EEPROM. Of course, those will not work on the Milk-V Duo.
